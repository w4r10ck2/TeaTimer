# TeaTimer
This TeaTimer is just a normal Timer with some extra features.
It is not the final version and I am just developing it for fun.

Features which are very likely to be added:

    - predefined times (green, black, Oolong...) (done)
    - option to change these times (done)
    - more alarm tones (done)
    - dark mode
    - full screen mode (partly done)
    - translation into german (done)
