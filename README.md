# TeaTimer
This TeaTimer is just a normal Timer with some extra features.
It is not the final version and I am just developing it for fun.

Features which are very likely to be added:

    - predefined times (green, black, white...)
    - option to change these times
    - more alarm tones (maybe file-Chooser)
    - dark mode
    - full screen mode
    - translation into german (done)

If you know some better features or features which should also be added,
send me an email and I will consider it: andreas.vogt3@gmail.com
